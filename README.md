# Google searches for covid symptoms vs. COVID-19 positive rate in the UK

## What is this?

This project forms part of the Codecademy online course "Analyze Data with R". Here I use R in an attempt to study the relation between the number of Google searches for "covid symptoms" and the proportion of positive tests performed in the UK at a given point in time. For reasons explained in the project itself, this must *not* be regarded as a thorough and solid statistical study, but rather as an exercise on R coding.

Comments and suggestions are very welcome!
